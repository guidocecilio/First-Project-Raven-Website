**Home Page / Index**

As part of the design it was decided to use an image of the artwork of a Raven album as a  frame for the page. Different modified versions of this image were used as a background for the other pages. 

Every page has a Navigation Bar and Social Media Links at the top and a Footer at the bottom with Copyright and a Link to Contact Information.

The Home Page has Latest News, Latest album and Latest Blog Information as well as the above links.

Html / CSS and Bootstrap were used to create a responsive site  creating columns where required such as in the Index and Media pages. Responsive tables were used as well, such as in the Discography and Links pages.

The Rodie Odinnkirk Resume website was used as a basis for the site and adapted to create the Required functionality.

I changed it to give the required Layout with central columns or table. 

A navigation bar was created at the top, social media icons below this to the right and the columns/ tables below and a footer at the bottom.

The Website was hosted and tested in Cloud9, creating all the required HTML pages, CSS page and storing required Images and sound files.

The code was run on Google Chrome and fully tested. It was also tested on Internet Explorer.

The Final Version of the code was deployed to GiTHB
